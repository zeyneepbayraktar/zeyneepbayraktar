# 💫 About Me:
I am a second-year Computer Science student at Dokuz Eylül University with a strong foundation in analytical problem-solving. My academic interests include Graph Theory, Discrete Mathematics, and Numerical Analysis, and I have recently developed a strong interest in Digital Electronics. After greatly enjoying my digital electronics course, I am eager to explore hands-on work with Arduino and embedded systems.<br>I am currently learning C# and SQL to strengthen my software development skills. Beyond technical abilities, I am highly motivated in research and academic writing, and I believe that clear, structured communication is a key component of successful engineering.<br>I am eager to apply my technical knowledge, analytical mindset, and growing interest in embedded and software systems to innovative and impactful projects.
